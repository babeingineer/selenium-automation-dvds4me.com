Dear client,

I've seen your loom video.
It was pretty easy, just copy the product ID and find the product and add the quantities and add to cart.
I'm expert in selenium automation in python, I'm sure I will finish your project in less than 2 hours.
If you send me offer, I can start immediately.

Best regards,
Michael.
